# Example docker-compose file for Cog
#
# This is intended as a minimal example of running an instance of Cog connected
# to Slack or Hipchat. To get started, you should create a new configuration
# based on your chat provider using the provided templates. There should be
# two override files in the same directory as this file:
#
# docker-compose.override.hipchat_example.yml
# docker-compose.override.slack_example.yml
#
# Select the one that matches your chat provider, and copy it to the same
# directory with the name docker-compose.override.yml.
#
# Next, you need to export some environment variables in the environment that
# docker-compose is called from:
#
#    * COG_HOST - this is not a Cog environment variable per se, but
#      one specifically for this docker-compose example. You should
#      set this to the host that cog can be accessed "from the
#      outside". If using docker-machine, for example, you could set
#      this to `docker-machine ip default`
#    * Provider-specific API configuration options are listed in the
#      docker-compose.override.yml file that you copied above and also
#      need to be set in order for Cog to connect to your provider.
#
# Once you have the required configuration exported, start Cog by running:
# docker-compose up
#
# The Cog API will be available on port 80 of $COG_HOST, while
# triggers can be invoked on port 3000.
#
# Note that this example is not intended for production use and cuts some
# corners for the sake of simplicity. Examples include hard-coded credentials
# for Postgres, persistence of Postgres and log data, and customization of
# other Cog configuration values.
#
# For complete installation and administration documentation, you should refer
# to the Cog Book, which can be found at:
#
# https://cog-book.operable.io/
