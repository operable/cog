# Cog

Cog brings the power of the command line to the place you collaborate with your team all the time -- your chat window.

Powerful access control means you can collaborate around even the most sensitive tasks with confidence. A focus on extensibility and adaptability means that you can respond quickly to the unexpected, without your team losing visibility.
